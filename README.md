# Bootcamp Homework 01: HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Overview
This project required us to analyze and refactor the html and css files of an existing webpage to ensure all the elements worked properly, fix any errors and clean up the code to make everything more efficient.

## List of updates
* Fixed the navigation link for Search Engine Optimization
* Gave all img tags alt text
* Updated h tags to follow sequential order for the page
* Updated all the div tags to follow current html5 semantics
* Added comments to all sections identifying what each section was in index.html
* Combined many of the css classes to simplify the file and get rid of redundancy
